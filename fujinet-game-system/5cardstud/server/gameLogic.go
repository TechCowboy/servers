/*
5 Card Stud Rules below to serve as guideline.

The logic to support below is not all implemented, and will be done as time allows.

Rules -  Assume Limit betting: Anti 1, Bringin 2,  Low 5, High 10
Suit Rank (for comparing first to act): S,H,D,C

Winning hands - tied hands split the pot, remainder is discarded

1. All players anti (e.g.) 1
2. First round
  - Player with lowest card goes first, with a mandatory bring in of 2. Option to make full bet (5)
	- Play moves Clockwise
	- Subsequent player can call 2 (assuming no full bet yet) or full bet 5
	- Subsequent Raises are inrecements of the highest bet (5 first round, or of the highest bet in later rounds)
	- Raises capped at 3 (e.g. max 20 = 5 + 3*5 round 1)
3. Remaining rounds
	- Player with highest ranked visible hand goes first
	- 3rd Street - 5, or if a pair is showing: 10, so max is 5*4 20 or 10*4 40
	- 4th street+ - 10
